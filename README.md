# Hangman_Python
This is just some code I did for fun to create a hangman game.

Due to personal technical difficulties, I am unable to add a jupyter notebook to the repository. So I have added a word document that has both the full code for the game as well as the rules.

Hopefully, once technical restraints are sorted (i.e., replace my broken laptop), I can make a jupyter notebook for people to try out themselves (or even make the code more efficient).
